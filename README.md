# vehicle_detection

Detecting small objects such as vehicles in aerial images is a complicated problem, 
because it is difficult or impossible to find a suitable feature space to solve 
the problem for small objects. 

In this project is presented DNN for vehicle detection

To implement DNN, we used Keras library , written in Python and capable of running on top of either TensorFlow or Theano.
